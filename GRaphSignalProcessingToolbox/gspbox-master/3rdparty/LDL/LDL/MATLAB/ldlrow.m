function [L, D] = ldlrow (A)
%LDLROW an m-file description of the algorithm used by LDL
%
% Example:
%  [L, D] = ldlrow (A)
%
%  Compute the L*D*L' factorization of A, by rows.  Returns
%  full L and D matrices.  This routine serves as an outline
%  of the numerical factorization performed by ldl.c.
%
%  Here is a diagram of how L is computed.  "a" means an
%  entry that is accessed at the kth step, and "c" means an
%  entry that is computed.  A "-" means neither accessed nor
%  computed.  A "1" means the value of the entry is L (the
%  unit diagonal of L), and it is accessed at the kth step.
%  A "." means the value is zero.
%
