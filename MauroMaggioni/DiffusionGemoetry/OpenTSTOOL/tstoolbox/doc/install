Installation of TSTOOL


I. Unpack the TSTOOL-package in an empty directory, maybe D:\tstool.
   This directory now contains something like :
   
   startup.m         - the matlab startup script that calls tstoolpath.m
   tstoolpath.m      - a script that sets parameters to run tstool
   tstoolbox         - the directory that contains all executable files, documentation etc.

II. Adjust startup.m :
	
	There must be a call to the script 'tstoolpath'
	in the startup.m script. Nothing more is required. 
	If you already have a startup script that contains
	settings for other packages, simply add tstoolpath
	to the end of the existing startup file.

	Make sure that startup.m is executed from Matlab when
	Matlab is started !

III. Adjust tstoolpath.m
	
	In file tstoolpath.m some site specific settings have to be done
	in oder to be able to start and work with tstool.
	Some hints are written as comment to this file.
