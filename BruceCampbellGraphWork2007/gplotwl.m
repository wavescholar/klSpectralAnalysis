% function [Xout,Yout]=gplotwl(A,xy,labelsca, lc)
%GPLOT Plot graph, as in "graph theory".
%   GPLOTWL(A,xy) plots the graph specified by A and xy. A graph, G, is
%   a set of nodes numbered from 1 to n, and a set of connections, or
%   edges, between them.  
%
%   In order to plot G, two matrices are needed. The adjacency matrix,
%   A, has a(i,j) nonzero if and only if node i is connected to node
%   j.  The coordinates array, xy, is an n-by-2 matrix with the
%   position for node i in the i-th row, xy(i,:) = [x(i) y(i)].
%   NEW - If A's non zero weights are not all the same than for each 
%   edge of the graph, its weight will be overlaid (i.e. text) at the
%   edges center point.
%   
%   GPLOTWL(A,xy,labelsca) - labelsca - user text label for nodes in a form suitable
%       for a vector call to text (i.e. cell array or padded string matrix - see text).
%       If empty no labels are drawn.
%   
%   GPLOTWL(A,xy,labelsca, lc) uses line type and color specified in the
%   string lc. See PLOT for possibilities.
%
%   [X,Y] = GPLOTWL(A,xy) returns the NaN-punctuated vectors
%   X and Y without actually generating a plot. These vectors
%   can be used to generate the plot at a later time if desired.
%   
%   See also SPY, TREEPLOT.
