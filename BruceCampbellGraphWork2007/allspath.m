% ALLSPATH - solve the All Pairs Shortest Path problem
% 
% Rapidly returns the shortest node-to-node distance along the edges of a
% graph, for all nodes in the graph.
% 
% USAGE: B = allspath(A)
% 
% A = input distance matrix between nodes
% B = shortest path distance matrix between all nodes
% 
% Notes: (1) For a graph with n nodes, A is an n-by-n distance matrix
%            giving the distances between adjacent nodes. Since the
%            distance from point i to point j is the same as the distance
%            from point j to point i, A must be a symmetric matrix
%        (2) The distance from a node to itself can either be entered as
%            zero or infinity. (Either will produce a correct result.) This
%            means that the diagonal elements of the matrix A must all be
%            either zero or infinity.
%        (3) The distance between nodes that are not adjacent to each
%            other must be entered as either zero or infinity. (Either will
%            produce a correct result.) This means that the (i,j) and (j,i)
%            elements of A, where i and j are non-adjacent nodes, must
%            all be either zero or infinity.
%        (4) If the input graph is not "connected," meaning that some
%            nodes cannot be reached from other nodes no matter how
%            many edges are traversed, then the distances between nodes
%            that cannot be connected will be returned as infinite.
%        (5) Distances between a node and itself are returned as zero.
%        (6) This function codifies an original algorithm created by
%            the author.
